# PowerRename

This Scripts is used to rename and delete files and folders. In the Simple Folder you find the scripts for the simple version of the PowerRename. In the Advanced Folder you find the scripts for the advanced version of the PowerRename with is still in development.

## Simple Version

Here is what you can do with the simple version of the PowerRename:

The Scirpt rename your Folder from 'family.guy.2022.720p.blueray' to family Guy (2022). But becarfull, the script only works if the folder name is in the right format. Movie name, year and usw. works fine.
Also the script can delete files and folders. In my case it is used to delete the sample files from the movies and the all .jpg files from the folder.
The main-Simple.ps1 is the main script. In there are all features of the scirpt. The other scripts are only funktions from the main script.

## Advanced Version

The edvanced version is still in development.
